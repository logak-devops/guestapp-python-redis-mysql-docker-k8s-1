# Scenario
```
A member of your team has developed a self-contained Very Exciting Guestbook in Python that requires deployment to a Production environment so the general public can visit it.
The Guestbook consists of 3 pages:
● a home page where visitors are invited to enter their name and keeps a count of the number of page views
● a submission/'Thanks' page for visitors that have entered their name
● a 'Visitors' page where previous visitors to the website are listed
Names of visitors to the site are stored in MySQL, and number of page views are stored in redis.
